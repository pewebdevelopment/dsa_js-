// Tree is the hierarical representation of data
// Element of tree is called Node
// The node from where a tree starts is called the Root Node
// The path connecting two nodes is called Edge
// The last node of a tree that has no children is called leaf node
// The number of edges required to take from root to a leaf node is called height of the tree.

// BINARY TREE
// Binary Tree is a type of tree in which a node can have maximum 2 number of children nodes.

// BINARY SEARCH TREE
/*
    Binary Search Tree is a special type of binary tree in which the elements are sorted and has the following properties:
    1- Left node < parent node
    2- Right node > parent node
    3- All left nodes < root node
    4- All right nodes > root node


    Types of Binary Tree
    1- Full Binary Tree: Each node have 0 or 2 children
    2- Complete Binary Tree: All levels are filled except last level that should be filled from the left
